	The purpose of this project was to demonstrate our abilities and understanding of the covered material from the Introduction to Computer Science class. The best way to cover every topic discussed was by creating a game. Among the ideas for the games was also one of the most famous games in the world - PacMan.

	One of the biggest challenges was the creation of the board. Firstly, the board was drawn using hard-coded shapes, since the whole program was going to be written in Processing. However, to make the board more dynamic, it was firstly read from a text file and then drawn.

	The Pac-Man (yellow square) was implemented as a separate object which can be controlled by arrows. The monster (represented by a pink square), a separate object as well, is making random decisions in terms of moving in possible directions when it arrives at a junction. The PacMan has three lives. In order to win the game, the Pac-Man has to eat all bubbles.

	This project was conducted under supervision of Jerome White and Nicole Lee. Several hours were spent in the Academic Resource Center with Nicole Lee who was a great help throughout the whole project. The project will be presented on December 16, 2014 at New York University in Abu Dhabi.
